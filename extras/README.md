# Extras Folder

 The `Extras` folder contains `projective.jl` for creating structures related 
 to finite projective planes of prime order.

 * `generate_points(p)` generates a list of the homogeneous coordinates of the 
 points (lines) of a finite projective plane of prime order `p`.
 * `incidence_matrix(p)` generates the point-line incidence matrix of a 
 projective plane of order `p`.
 * `incidence_graph(p)` generates the bipartite point-line incidence graph 
 of a finite projective plane of order `p`.
